<h2>What to do while there</h2>
<ol>
  <li> EAT!</li>
  <p>Seriously, Thailand has some of the best and cheapest food in the World.<br>
    In the US eating nine meals a day would give you type two diabetes.<br>
    Luckily Thai food is also some of the healthiest food in the world.</p>

  <p>The first time I went to thailand to meet Junes' Family,<br>
    I thought they were trying to kill me.<br>
    every time we walked by a food stall, vendor or restaurant <br>
  either her, or my mother or sister in law would shove a plate of tasty looking food into my face.<br>
  by five o'clock every day I just wanted nothing more to do with food ever again.<br>
  Below you can see a picture of one of these torture feasts</p>

  <p>Mark Wiens probably has the best Travel Blog on what to eat in Thailand.<br>
  I have trouble watching his beautiful face as he chows down on amazing looking food once a weeek<br>
click on the chili pepper below for a link to his' web-blog</p>

  <li>Feed the fish</li>
  <p>The buddhist religion focuses on sustainable living and consumption of animals <br>
    this includes sustainable fishing</br>
    below you can see a video of a place where we were trying to feed some geese.</p>
